    "Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multiple Inheritance: \n",
    "When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances. In multiple inheritances, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multilevel Inheritance :\n",
    "In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class. This is similar to a relationship representing a child and a grandfather. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.Hierarchical Inheritance: \n",
    "When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes.\n",
